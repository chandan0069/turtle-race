# Turtle Race

## Description
This Python program simulates a turtle race using the Turtle module. Users can place bets on which turtle they think will win the race by entering a color. The turtles move randomly across the screen, and the first turtle to reach the finish line (x-coordinate of 350) determines the winner.

## Usage
1. Run the e.g.`turtle_race.py` script using Python.
2. The program prompts the user to enter their bet by specifying the color of the turtle they think will win.
3. Once the user has placed their bet, the race begins.
4. Turtles move randomly across the screen.
5. The race continues until one of the turtles crosses the finish line.
6. Upon completion of the race, the program displays whether the user's bet was successful or not.

## Installation
1. Ensure Python is installed on your system. If not, download and install it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/).
2. No additional installation is required as the Turtle module comes pre-installed with Python.
